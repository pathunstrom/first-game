# Zombie Apocalypse

A tiny "twin-stick" shooter built on Pygame primitives.

## About

This was my very first game in Python, found languishing away in a directory on
one cloud server or another. I had only the barest understanding of Python and
Pygame at the time as evidenced by the gnarly `if else` trees and the giant app
loop.

The theme was chosen by my children, and the final product was a compromise
between the idea and my ability.

## Features

* Two weapons
* Four-direction movement
* Eight-direction aim
* Multi-state enemies
* Simulated weapon sound

## Run It

Requires Python and Pygame to run.

Run with `python zombieapocalypse.py`

Can also be set as executable in a Unix like environment and run with
`zombieapocalypse.py`

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to move and the Z and X keys to shoot.
